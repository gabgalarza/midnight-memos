Every single time. I just let someone get me angry over anything, ANYTHING.

They said something that pissed me off. Now my day's ruined, let's think about it until my brain starts to hurt. Just stick a knife in my head. Just do it.

Over-sensitivity has been my ultimate weakness ever since I can remember and the only way I know how to cope with it is to throw myself into work. Crank out 1,000,000 lines of code so I can forget that I'm a self-punching bag, looking to crawl in a hole when things get tough.

I don't know. It's just what I do, and i'm tired of it. Just fucking exhausted.

Maybe it'll get better.

I'm hungry. It's time to self soothe.
